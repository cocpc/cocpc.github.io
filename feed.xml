                <p>Hello, everyone! I am Winrich and welcome to my blog.</p>
<h2 id="my-story">My Story</h2>
<p>I was born in a small city in central China, and I have faced various challenges and difficulties in my family. When I was around six years old, my parents lost their jobs, and then my father suffered a stroke, resulting in partial paralysis. Growing up in such an environment, I felt a sense of unease and confusion about life.</p>
<p>My childhood memories have become quite blurry, but I still vividly remember a moment in the fourth grade when I was punished by the teacher for being late and mocked by my classmates. It was during that time that I learned to hide my anxiety and put on a carefree facade. However, the teacher’s words - “Shake your leg in front of your disabled father” - left me disheartened and made me lose my gratitude towards the world.</p>
<p>During my adolescence, I went through a period of waywardness, skipping classes, and even attempting dangerous activities. After experiencing a series of setbacks, I developed an interest in computers and started learning web design and programming languages.</p>
<h2 id="investment-and-trading">Investment and Trading</h2>
<p>In 2007, I began to explore the world of futures trading, and through trial and error, I gradually understood the complexities of investment and trading. However, the initial experiences were full of failures and losses, leading me to realize that investing is not a mere game but an art that requires serious study and careful planning.</p>
<p>After a series of ups and downs, I grew into an investor and developed my own “Cycle Trading Rules.” During a period of introspection and contemplation, my understanding of trading and my mentality underwent a qualitative transformation.</p>
