            <p>Hello, everyone! I am Winrich and welcome to my blog.</p>
<h2 id="my-story">My Story</h2>
<p>I was born in a small city in central China, and I have faced various challenges and difficulties in my family. When I was around six years old, my parents lost their jobs, and then my father suffered a stroke, resulting in partial paralysis. Growing up in such an environment, I felt a sense of unease and confusion about life.</p>
<p>My childhood memories have become quite blurry, but I still vividly remember a moment in the fourth grade when I was punished by the teacher for being late and mocked by my classmates. It was during that time that I learned to hide my anxiety and put on a carefree facade. However, the teacher’s words - “Shake your leg in front of your disabled father” - left me disheartened and made me lose my gratitude towards the world.</p>
<p>During my adolescence, I went through a period of waywardness, skipping classes, and even attempting dangerous activities. After experiencing a series of setbacks, I developed an interest in computers and started learning web design and programming languages.</p>
<h2 id="investment-and-trading">Investment and Trading</h2>
<p>In 2007, I began to explore the world of futures trading, and through trial and error, I gradually understood the complexities of investment and trading. However, the initial experiences were full of failures and losses, leading me to realize that investing is not a mere game but an art that requires serious study and careful planning.</p>
<p>After a series of ups and downs, I grew into an investor and developed my own “Cycle Trading Rules.” During a period of introspection and contemplation, my understanding of trading and my mentality underwent a qualitative transformation.</p>
<h2 id="about-this-blog">About This Blog</h2>
<p>This blog serves as a record of my investment and trading journey and also as a platform to share my experiences and insights with readers. Through sharing my stories and insights, I hope to motivate more people to embark on the path of investment and become better traders.</p>
<p>The domain name of this blog is “imwin.org,” which symbolizes “I’m a winner,” and serves as a proud declaration of my trading journey. Through this blog, I hope to connect with readers, engage in discussions about the world of investment, and grow and progress together.</p>
<h2 id="about-winrich">About “Winrich”</h2>
<p>“Winrich” is the English name I have chosen for myself. “Win” represents victory and success, while “rich” symbolizes wealth and abundance. For me, this name is not only a personal aspiration but also a constant reminder to maintain a positive mindset and focused spirit in my trading endeavors.</p>
<h2 id="contact-me">Contact Me</h2>
<p>If you are interested in my stories and trading experiences or have any questions and suggestions, feel free to reach out to me. You can contact me via email at <a href="mailto:blog@imwin.org">blog@imwin.org</a>  or find me on social media. Looking forward to connecting with you!</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting my blog, and I hope you find valuable information and inspiration here!</p>
